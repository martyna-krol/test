        <h1>Sometimes you can't make it on your own</h1>
        <h3>by U2</h3>
        <p>Tough<br>
            You think you've got the stuff<br>
            You're telling me and anyone<br>
            You're hard enough<br>
            You don't have to put up a fight<br>
            You don't have to always be right<br>
            Let me take some of the punches<br>
            For you tonight<br>
            Listen to me now<br>
            I need to let you know<br>
            You don't have to go it alone<br>
            And it's you when I look in the mirror<br>
            And it's you when I don't pick up the phone<br>
            Sometimes you can't make it on your own<br>
            We fight all the time<br>
            You and I, that's alright<br>
            We're the same soul<br>
            I don't need, I don't need to hear you say<br>
            That if we weren't so alike<br>
            You'd like me a whole lot more<br>
            Listen to me now<br>
            I need to let you know<br>
            You don't have to go it alone<br>
            And it's you when I look in the mirror<br>
            And it's you when I don't pick up the phone<br>
            Sometimes you can't make it on your own<br>
            I know that we don't talk<br>
            I'm sick of it all<br>
            Can you hear me when I sing?<br>
            You're the reason I sing<br>
            You're the reason why the opera is in me<br>
            Hey now<br>
            Still got to let you know<br>
            A house doesn't make a home<br>
            Don't leave me here alone<br>
            And it's you when I look in the mirror<br>
            And it's you that makes it hard to let go<br>
            Sometimes you can't make it on your own<br>
            Sometimes you can't make it<br>
            Best you can do, is to fake it<br>
            Sometimes you can't make it on your own</p>
